/**
 * Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
 *
 * (i.e., [0,0,1,2,2,5,6] might become [2,5,6,0,0,1,2]).
 *
 * You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return true, otherwise return false.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
 * Output: true
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
 * Output: false
