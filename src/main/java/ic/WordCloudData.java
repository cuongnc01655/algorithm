/**
 * You want to build a word cloud, an infographic where the size of a word corresponds to how often it appears in the body of text.
 * To do this, you'll need data. Write code that takes a long string and builds its word cloud data in a hash map â†´ , where the keys are words and the values are the number of times the words occurred.
 *
 * Think about capitalized words. For example, look at these sentences:
 *
 *   "After beating the eggs, Dana read the next step:"
 * "Add milk and eggs, then add flour and sugar."
 * What do we want to do with "After", "Dana", and "add"? In this example, your final hash map should include one "Add" or "add" with a value of
 * 2
 * 2. Make reasonable (not necessarily perfect) decisions about cases like "After" and "Dana".
 *
 * Assume the input will only contain words and standard punctuation.
 *
 * You could make a reasonable argument to use regex in your solution. We won't, mainly because performance is difficult to measure and can get pretty bad.
